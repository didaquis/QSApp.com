	<p>Hopefully this site will be the 'new' home for Quicksilver and everything that comes with it.<br />
The idea is to bring everything that's been happening to Quicksilver since it went open source together in one beautiful, unified place.</p>
<p>		At the moment we have the <a href="plugins">plugins repository</a>, as well as a <a href="wiki">wiki</a> that's being set up.</p>
<p>If you've always wanted to help with Quicksilver, but have never had the Cocoa coding skills, then this may just be your chance!<br />
You know PHP, HTML, MySQL, or anything webby? You want to help right now?! Cool, just email help@qsapp.com :)</p>
